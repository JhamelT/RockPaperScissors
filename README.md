# RockPaperScissors
A classic game or tie breaker, the rules to rock-paper-scissors are:

Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper
Paper beats Rock

The user is prompted to type in "rock", "paper", or "scissors". 
The user's choice is compared to the game's choice (randomly generated). And a winner is determined.
The program notifies the user of the winner or the tie.
The user is prompted to play again.
The process repeats until the user types "stop".
